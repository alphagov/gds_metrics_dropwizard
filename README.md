# GDS metrics for Dropwizard apps

GDS Metrics are in Alpha and these instructions are subject to change.

The GDS [Dropwizard][] metrics library enables your Java web app to export performance data to [Prometheus][] and can be added to your app using this library.

The library is a thin wrapper around the [Prometheus instrumentation library for JVM applications][] that adds a PrometheusBundle you can include in your dropwizard app.

Once youâ€™ve added the library, metrics data is served from an endpoint on your app and is scraped by Prometheus. This data can be turned into performance dashboards using [Grafana][].

You can read more about the Reliability Engineering monitoring solution [here][].

## Before using GDS metrics

Before using GDS metrics you should have:

* created a Dropwizard app

## How to build your project

Add your library as a dependency to your project.

    Maven
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>uk.gov.ida</groupId>
        <artifactId>gds-metrics-dropwizard</artifactId>
        <version>0.7.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    Gradle
    ```
    implementation 'uk.gov.ida:gds-metrics-dropwizard:0.7.0'
    ```

The metrics will be exposed at the path /prometheus/metrics on the admin port.

## How to Change your project

Add the `PrometheusBundle`:

```
public void initialize(final Bootstrap<ExampleConfiguration> bootstrap) {
    ...
    bootstrap.addBundle(new PrometheusBundle());
    ...
}
```

Your metrics endpoint will now be available in your production environment.

## How to configure custom metrics

While common metrics are recorded by default, you can also:

* record your own metrics such as how many users are signed up for your service, or how many emails it's sent
* use the [Prometheus interface][] to set your own metrics as the metrics Dropwizard library is built on top of the `prometheus_java_client`

You can read more about the different types of metrics available in the [Prometheus documentation][].

## Contributing

GDS Reliability Engineering welcome contributions. We'd appreciate it if you write tests with your changes and document them where appropriate, this will help us review them quickly.

## Releasing a new version

To release a new version:

 - bump the version in gradle.properties and the dependencies in the README
   and commit
 - tag with the new version number and push the tag (eg `git tag 0.1.3; git push --tags`)
 - travis will build and deploy the new version to bintray
 - bump the version in gradle.properties to the next SNAPSHOT (eg `0.1.3-SNAPSHOT`)
